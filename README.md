Hi!

Here you'll find the demo and study material for my Pluralsight course [Build an Object Detection Solution with Microsoft Azure Custom Vision Service](https://pluralsight.pxf.io/custom-vision-object-detection).

I hope you enjoyed the course. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate don't contact me!
